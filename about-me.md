## This is a text document describing Emmaline Mercer's experience:

- What programming languages have you used?
    - The programming languages I have used include Java, JavaScript, Python, C, and SQL.
- Did you code mostly in classes, internships, real jobs, or personal projects? Put example projects and what did you do.
    - I coded mostly in internships, but learned various languages through class projects. In my internships, I gained experience coding in both frontend and backend work. (Project examples are located in my portfolio website at the bottom of this sub-list)
    - I used to work at the Digital Corps here at Ball State, and worked on frontend work for the biology department's Herbarium website to classify plants.
    - I am working with Genesys part-time this year, and I worked with them this past summer. The majority of work I did involved feature implementations into already working systems, primarily with observability frameworks.
    - This is a portfolio website I created: (webpage link) https://eewmercer.github.io/portfolio-website/ & (GitHub link) https://github.com/eewmercer/portfolio-website
- What was the largest program/system youâ€™ve worked on?
    - The largest system I worked on involved implementing observability tools into Genesys' services. I collected the metrics and data from these services, queried them, and then made them viewable in charts and tables.
- What do you feel most comfortable doing in code?
    - I feel most comfortable working on frontend work, but I've learned more backend this summer.
- What do you feel least comfortable doing?
    - I feel the least comfortable with new frameworks. I've used React and Vue primarily, so my knowledge is weaker in this area.
