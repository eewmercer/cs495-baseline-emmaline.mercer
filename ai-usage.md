## A document describing the level of AI used:
- I used AI to do the following:
    - While programming, I used Google gemini while looking up syntax and methods specific to Python. I have been primarily a Java and JavaScript user, so there were gaps in my knowledge.
    - GitHub Copilot was also used in error checking specific lines.
- I completed the following myself:
    - I wrote the tests and slugify function with my own knowledge and use of resources like StackOverflow, GeeksforGeeks, etc.
- Verification:
    - I compared various different python methods that AI provided me with, and used the ones that I believe worked best for the slugify function's purposes, such as comparing the characters in the provided test strings with ascii letters.
